# Fordgobike Data Exploration
## by Teniola Alade


## Dataset

The data consists of information regarding 174,952 bike rides, including the time duration in seconds of bike ride, the user-type (Subscriber or Customer), the gender of the user and so many other qualities.


## Summary of Findings

> In the exploration of duration against age, I found that there was a weak negative correlation between the 
duration of the trip and the age of the user - the relationship is inversely proportional. When I investigated further by ploting against both the user type and the gender, there was no notable difference.

> In the duration against gender plot, the female gender had marginally longer trip duration than the male gender,
while the daily ride duration showed that the user rode the bikes longer on the weekends than the weekday, with a marginal difference. However,
by furthering the investigation, I discovered that the other gender actually spent the most time on the bike, followed by the female gender regardless of the days of the week.



## Key Insights for Presentation

> For the presentation, I focused on just the influence of the duration of the trip. 
I started by introducing the age variable, followed by the both the gender and user-type variables, and lastly the days of the week variable.

Afterwards, I introduced each of the categorical variables one by one. To start,
I use the scatter plots of duration and age across gender . I'm only looking at
the gender plot here to further understand how the gender affects the duration against age plot.
Then, I also used a scatter plot of duration and age across user-type for further investigation
into the bivariate plot.

The other categorical variables, days of the week, are covered afterwards, using point plots. I've made
sure to use different color palettes for each quality variable to make sure it
is clear that they're different between plots.
